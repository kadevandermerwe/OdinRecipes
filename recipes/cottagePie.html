            <li>1 beef stock cube</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>100g peas</li>
            <li>1kg Tesco all rounder potatoes</li>

        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and in a large frying pan, heat the olive oil. Saute the onion, carrot, celery and garlic on a medium heat until softened, then add the beef mince. Turn up the heat for 4-5 minutes and fry until the mince is browned.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, peel, halve and boil the potatoes for 20 minutes or until soft. Drain and allow to steam for 10 minutes. Preheat the oven to gas 4, 180°C, 160°C. Add the tomato puree, tinned tomatoes, stock cube, bay leaf and salt and pepper to the mince mixture. Fill the tomato tin with water and add that as well. Bring to the boil and simmer for 15 minutes to reduce. Add the peas at the last minute and mix through. Remove the bay leaf.
        </li>
        <li>Once the potatoes have steamed, mash them well with plenty of salt and the butter cubes until the butter is melted and mixed through. Pour the mince mixture into an ovenproof dish and top with the mash. Use a fork to rough up the top to help it colour. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until piping hot and golden. Serve immediately.</li>
